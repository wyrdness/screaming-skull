      "full": "The Screaming Skull is a distinctive phenomenon in British and European folklore involving human skulls that allegedly possess supernatural properties, most notably emitting piercing screams or bringing misfortune when removed from their designated locations. These skulls, often associated with specific manor houses, castles, or historic buildings, are believed to be the remains of individuals who died violent or tragic deaths and whose spirits refuse to rest unless their skulls remain in particular places. The phenomenon represents an intersection of death customs, property hauntings, and relic veneration, with documented cases spanning several centuries."
